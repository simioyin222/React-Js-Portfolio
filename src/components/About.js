      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <em>Similoluwa Oyinkolade</em>, but people usually call me
        Simi. What's really important to know about me is that I moved to
        Chicago not too long ago and I'm loving it so far! I'm a full-time
        streamer and content creator and I enjoy a lot of other things within
        those ranges as well. Currently, I'm working towards becoming a software
        engineer/video game developer. My time at Epicodus has been good so far
        and I'm hopeful for more positive experiences on this long road ahead.
